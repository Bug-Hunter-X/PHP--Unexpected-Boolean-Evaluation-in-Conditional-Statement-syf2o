This example demonstrates a common issue in PHP where a function's return value is used in a conditional statement without explicitly checking for specific falsey values.  The code might behave unexpectedly if the function returns 0, an empty string, or FALSE, as these all evaluate to false in a boolean context.  The solution shows how to explicitly check for the desired values.
